I"ð<p>At my day job we have spent the past year or more going over, and automating our whole infrastructure. A part of this process was also increasing our security controls. On all our linux machines we are now at CIS and OpenSCAP compliance levels.</p>

<p>Now back at home I have been building a new Ryzen 9 3900x based machine and thought a good experiement would be to try and crack some of the passwords we require our staff to generate.</p>

<p>Hashcat to the rescue. Install it on my Debian based system was the standard</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install hashcat</code></p>

<p>Next I had to download a dictionary file. The one I downloaded via a torrent was crackstation list.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">https://crackstation.net/crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm</code></p>

<p>I then grabbed one of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/shadow</code> hashes one of my staff had generated. I know this is a SHA512 as we generate them with some python code and push them out via ansible. This example has been modified.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">echo $6$UbAY9/dOfT.JSlNR$cm18pOdW5/SJvxcO1VXXXXXWrNs8/L3qVqesJhpIpF8pj1XXXXXG57Twlv8/hkQj9janCxwFKh6dwxxzLXXXXX &gt; hash.txt</code></p>

<p>Before starting the process I decided to throw another Nvidia GTX 1080 in my rig to speed things up since hashcat uses GPUâ€™s to speed things up.</p>

<p>To kick things off I used the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 --session session1 -o cracked.txt hash.txt ./crackstation.txt -O -w 3</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-m 1800</code> is the hash type, in this case 1800 is the SHA512 in the standard linux format</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">-a 0</code> is the attack type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">--session session1</code> will allow you to restart from a checkpoint if something happens</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">-o cracked.txt</code> is the output file, or the file which will be used to store the discovered password if it can</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">hash.txt</code> is the input file containing our single hash</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./crackstation.txt</code> is our dictionary file</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">-w 3</code> puts a high priority on the job, and makes using the system almost impossible when itâ€™s running</p>

<p>Once running I gathered the following information</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Speed.#*.........:   267.9 kH/s</code> kiloHashes a second</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hardware.Mon.#1..: Temp: 82c Fan: 54% Util:100% Core:1645MHz Mem:4513MHz Bus:4</code> GPU 0</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hardware.Mon.#2..: Temp: 83c Fan: 55% Util: 99% Core:1607MHz Mem:4513MHz Bus:16</code> GPU 1</p>

<p>The job finished in about 1.5 hours and could not crack the password which I was very happy about.</p>
