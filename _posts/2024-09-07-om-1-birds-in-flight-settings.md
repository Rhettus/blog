# Intro
I have had the OM-1 for 6+ months and feel like I am only just coming to grips with it. Generally I use a base ISO of 1600 which I find most software has no issues with removing noise, this allows me to keep the shutter speed up in most situations. If you just want to blindly apply my settings, you can skip to the end and download my settings file which can be applied using OM Workstation. 

While the OM-1 has the excellent SH2 drive mode which can do blackout free 50fps RAW files, there is some downside to using it. Firstly is affects the EVF preview, generally the scene looks darker in the EVF, (it doesnt change with exposure changes) for this reason it's important to read the histogram for expsoure when using it. The other downside is you can not drop the shutter below 1/640th of a second, this is no problem for birds in flight, but is a limitation when shooting perched birds in dark forest. Remember the OM-1 has excellent IBIS, I use it down to 1/40th of a second safely which really helps to keep ISO down. 

These settings suit my style of getting the most out of the OM-1, I expose to the right of the histogram which produces a very bright image. But once pulled down in post it shows minimal noise. I'm always looking at the histogram in the EVF. 

# Pre-requisits 

## Perform a factory reset
Even if your camera is new or especially if it is used, perform a factory reset. I have had unknown settings affect my C-AF autofocus accuracy.. Shoot factory and change minimal settings with regards to autofocus.

## Upgrade firmware
This article assumes firemware v1.7, which makes the `All` focus points with bird detection more usable. 

Note: During firmware updates, shutter speed in all modes, date and language are usually lost and need to be reset.


# Global settings
These are settings I keep the same through all the Custom modes or globally

## Micsulanous Settings
No one needs the AF light on the front of the camera for distance birds, its just a distraction.

## Picture Settings

I always shoot RAW only. Ensure this is set, the default is a medium jpeg. Here is a general overview of the Super Control panel, you can access this by pressing `ok`

## Autofocus Settings
For birds, I'm always in C-AF+MF. I use back button focus and disable the focus on half press

This settings allows manual focus override while still using autofocus, it can be handy when the camera gets confused and focuses on the wrong thing.

This setting puts boxes around the bird, the birds head and hopefully the birds eye. I use on1 as opposed to on2 which also shows green boxes over the focus area. I really try to look for the head and eye boxes and on2 tends to get in the way.

Back button AF is enabled by default but so is focusing by half pressing the shutter button. I disable the half press shutter button AF and just focus with the `AF-ON` button on the rear of the camera

## EVF Settings

### Hightlights & Histogram
Once the following have been set, press the "info" button on the back of the camera to enable it. I actually set these in information 2. To test you should see the histogram in the EVF and if you over exposure and clip highlights, they should turn RED, or underexpose and clip they will turn BLUE. The objective to over expose your shots, but not clip in RED.

### Grid colors

## Buttons and Dials
The `front dial` is always set the change the shutter speed. The `back dial` changes the aperture (if in manual mode) or exposure compenstation if in shutter or aperture priority.  I try to keep them as consistent as possible so when I change modes it feels natural.

For Shutter priority based modes. (C3)

### Toggle switch
In each custom mode below, I use the toggle switch to quickly can the number of focus points. In the first position `All` focus points are selected. In each custom mode you need to change the EVF view, Autofocus drive mode etc, then save the mode.

### AEL
I assign this to magnify. Once pressed you can zoom in our out using the front dial. To exit hit the `ok` button. I find this relly useful even if I'm not particularly going to take a photo of a bird but rather just identify a bird.

## Wifi/Bluetooth/Airplane

I turn these off by default (by turning airplane mode on) and only enable them if needed. This helps save battery.

# Custom Modes

## C1 - General Birds, Perched Birds
I use this mode based off the `manual` mode, this allows independant control of the shutter speed and aperture. I use this mode the most of the time now as long as the bird stays in the same lighting conditions.

- Exposure mode - Manual 
- Subject detection - Birds
- Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
- ISO 1600 - This can be changed
- Drive mode - Silient sequential - 20fps 
- Shutter speed - 1/500th
- Meter mode - ESP

## C2 - Birds in Flight
I use this mode based off the `aperture priority` mode when shooting birds in flight. It adjusts for exposure changes faster than I can in manual modes. IT allows independant control of the aperture (rear dial) which I rarely use as I keep it wide open, but allows exposure compenstation to be used with the front dial. 

- Exposure mode - Aperture priority (wide open) 
- Subject detection - Birds
- Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
- ISO 1600 - This can be changed by holding down the ISO button and adjusting with the front dial
- Drive mode - SH2 - 50fps 
- Shutter speed - 1/2500th
- Meter mode - ESP

## C3 - Pro-Capture

I use this mode based off the `shutter priority` mode to shoot birds about to take off or land on a perch. It allows independant control of the  shutter (front dial), and allows exposure compenstation to be used with the rear dial. 

- Exposure mode - Aperture priority (wide open) 
- Subject detection - Birds
- Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
- Auto ISO (up to 12800) - This can be changed by holding down the ISO button and adjusting with the front dial
- Drive mode - Procap SH2 - 50fps 
- Shutter speed - Start at 1/2500th
- Meter mode - ESP

# MySets

I use this menu, right at the end to easy access settings which are buried in the menus. They are like shortcuts, but usually not used for birds
