# Intro
I have had the OM-1 for 6+ months and feel like I am only just coming to grips with it. Generally I use a base ISO of 1600 which I find most software has no issues with removing noise, this allows me to keep the shutter speed up in most situations. If you just want to blindly apply my settings, you can skip to the end and download my settings file which can be applied using OM Workstation. 

While the OM-1 has the excellent SH2 drive mode which can do blackout free 50fps RAW files, there is some downside to using it. Firstly is affects the EVF preview, generally the scene looks darker than the EVF records, for this reason it's important to read the histogram for expsoure. The other downside is you can not drop the shutter below 1/640th of a second, this is no problem for birds in flight, but is a limitation when shooting perched birds in dark forest. Remember the OM-1 has excellent IBIS, I use it down to 1/40th of a second safely which really helps to keep ISO down. 

These settings suit my style of getting the most out of the OM-1, I expose to the rigth of the histogram but produces a very bright image. But once pulled down in post it shows minimal noise. I'm always looking at the histogram in the EVF. 

# Pre-requisits 

## Perform a factory reset
Even if your camera is new or especially if it is used, perform a factory reset. I have had unknown settings affect my C-AF autofocus accuracy.. Shoot factory and change minimal settings with regards to autofocus.

## Upgrade firmware
This article assumes firemware v1.7, which makes the `All` focus points with bird detection more usable. 

Note: During firmware updates, shutter speed in all modes, date and language are usually lost and need to be reset.


# Global settings
These are settings I keep the same through all the Custom modes or globally

## Picture Settings

I always shoot RAW only. Ensure this is set, the default is a medium jpeg

## EVF Settings

### Hightlights

### Histogram

### Grid colors

## Buttons and Dials
The `front dial` is always set the change the shutter speed. The `back dial` changes the aperture (if in manual mode) or exposure compenstation if in shutter or aperture priority.  

### Toggle switch
In each custom mode below, I use the toggle switch to quickly can the number of focus points. In the first position `All` focus points are selected

### AEL
I assign this to magnify. Once pressed you can zoom in our out using the front dial. To exit hit the `ok` button. I find this relly useful even if I'm not particularly going to take a photo of a bird but rather just identify a bird.

## Wifi/Bluetooth/Airplane

I turn these off by default (by turning airplane mode on) and only enable them if needed. This helps save battery.


# Custom Modes

## C1 - General Birds, Perched Birds
I use this mode based off the `manual` mode, this allows independant control of the shutter speed and aperture. I use this mode the most now as long as the bird stays in the same lighting conditions.

Exposure mode - Manual 
Subject detection - Birds
Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
ISO 1600 - This can be changed
Drive mode - Silient sequential - 20fps 
Shutter speed - 1/500th
Meter mode - ESP

## C2 - Birds in Flight
I use this mode based off the `aperture` mode, this allows independant control of the  aperture (rear dial) which I rarely use as I keep it wide open, but allows exposure compenstation to be used with the front dial. 

Exposure mode - Aperture priority (wide open) 
Subject detection - Birds
Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
ISO 1600 - This can be changed by holding down the ISO button and adjusting with the front dial
Drive mode - SH2 - 50fps 
Shutter speed - 1/2500th
Meter mode - ESP

## C3 - Pro-Capture

I use this mode based off the `shutter` mode, this allows independant control of the  shutter (front dial), and allows exposure compenstation to be used with the rear dial. 

Exposure mode - Aperture priority (wide open) 
Subject detection - Birds
Autofocus mode - C-AF + MF
Auto ISO (up to 12800) - This can be changed by holding down the ISO button and adjusting with the front dial
Drive mode - Procap SH2 - 50fps 
Shutter speed - Start at 1/2500th
Meter mode - ESP
