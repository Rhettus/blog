In order for me to do auto Z leveling so I can actually get consistent first layers, I needed to replace my CRTouch probe with a klicky probe, or any probe which can push down another probe to caluculate the z-offset each time. There are serveral advantages in doing this anyway - including a lighter toolhead, more travel room and last but not least getting rid of that rattle box.

I travelled the internet looking for a complete guide on installing a klicky probe on my EVA 2.4 toolhead and could not find one, only parts, and not specific to my printer. So this post will track my progress on installing a klicky probe to my Mercury One (Ender 5 Pro with Octopus 1.1 MCU)

Full credits go to `turtlecrawler` for creating the parts and doing the initial write up on discord.

## BOM (Build of materials)
These are the parts you will need on hand to build a klicky probe
8x 3x6mm n52 magnets
CA glue (Super Glue)
1x D2F-5 or D2F-5L micro switches (Remove the lever if you have one with a lever)
2x m3 heatset inserts
2x M2x10 self tapping screws
2x M3x20 Socket Head Cap Screws
2x M5x10 Socket Head Cap Screws
2x M5 Roll in spring T-nuts
22-24awg wire
JST-SM or Microfit 3.0 connectors are recommended for use at the hotend

## Printed parts
All parts should be printed in ASA or ABS. 

All parts were downloaded from the ZeroG discorder server under the "Community" channel. Download the "[Klicky_-_Trihorn_Ducxt_-_Merc.zip](https://discord.com/channels/747612067951018075/1010991671426682951)" 
I'm also running the Revo hotend, so printed the Narrow/Default trihorn.
All parts should be printed in ASA or ABS. 
Since I'm running an old Ender 5 Pro with the original 235x235 bed I used the 65mm dock.

## Assembly


## Klipper Configuration
Create a new directory in mainsail or fluidd and name it klicky

Upload all config files from the klicky zip into the klicky directory

Add `[include klicky/klicky-probe.cfg]` to your printer.cfg

Comment out or remove your current `[safe_z_home]` section, The klicky cfg includes a new safe z home.

If switching from a BLtouch, remove the `[bltouch]` z_offset from the save_config section.

```
[stepper_z]
endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop
position_min: -15.0
position_max: 300
homing_speed: 12 ### Currently running my first homing speed at 20 ###
second_homing_speed: 5
```

```
[probe]
pin: ^PG10 ### Check your board pinout, this is an example pin ###
x_offset: -2
y_offset: 28.75
z_offset: 0
speed: 5 ### I have found it accurate on my setup running as fast as 10, at 16 the accuracy started to degrade ###
samples:1 ### Klicky is accurate enough for a single sample, the remaining lines are not needed if you run a single sample ###
samples_result: median
sample_retract_dist: 1.0
samples_tolerance: 0.02
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
```

You only need to edit `klicky-probe.cfg` and `klicky-variables.cfg`
You should only have to adjust the dock location, bed size, and tool head park location.
